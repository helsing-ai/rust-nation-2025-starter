# Helsing Drone Challenge Starter Repo: Rust Nation 2025

## Instructions

Come up with a creative <team_name>, or use your own name (user.name)!

Get started with:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <team_name>" -X POST http://172.236.8.116:10300/challenge/drone
```

Receive further instructions:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <team_name>" -X GET http://172.236.8.116:10300/challenge/drone
```

Then, use your preferred language and go!

## Using the template (optional)

Beyond the instructions above, you can also clone this repository and use it as a starter template. It's a `nix`-powered Rust project that should save you some time setting things up.

> [!TIP]
> Using this template is completely optional. If you want to start from scratch and fight dependencies yourself, go for it!

## Visualisation

If you want to watch everything live, there will be a screen in the room with a 3D view of all the current attempts. This will also contain the leaderboard, so you can see who's in the lead!

Otherwise, check out `http://172.236.8.116:8080/` from the comfort of your own screen.
